# algos - Getting started with Go

I created this repository just to learn go. One of the best way to learn a new language is to implement basic Data structure & Algorithms. This gives
basic idea of the language.

## Project Setup
Basic go project must be setup under `$GOPATH`. If you are new, just create projects inside GOPATH.
I use mac, I set it up inside my `$HOME/go` which is my `$GOPATH`.

```sh
.
algos
|__src
    |__Algo
    |   |__search
    |       |__Binary
    |            |__ binary_search.go
    |            |__ binary_test.go
    |__ DS
        |__tree
            |__bst
            |    |__ bst.go    
            |    |__ bst_test.go
            |__ main.go   
```
