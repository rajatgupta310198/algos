I created this repository just to learn go. One of the best way to learn a new language is to implement basic Data structure & Algorithms. This gives
basic idea of the language.

## Project Setup
Basic go project must be setup under `$GOPATH`. If you are new, just create projects inside GOPATH.
I use mac, I set it up inside my `$HOME/go` which is my `$GOPATH`.

```sh
.
algos
|---|__binary
    |__graph
    |__jump
    |__other
    |__tree
 |_ main.go
```
